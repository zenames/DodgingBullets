# DodgingBullets
This is my first game created with LibGDX without Box2D
HitBoxes, Collision Detection, Bullet Random Generator/Trajectories, HighScore, and the File saving system are all self made.

Games incomplete, but working.



This game is a time survival 2D game where you attempt to dodge bullets, the game gets increasingly harder every 3 seconds.
The Key D is to reset the Difficulty and Changes GameStates to PlayState, as long as the bullets are not at the aliens position (Will switch to menustate and draw a scoreboard), D button will restart the game
Controls:
Up, Down, Left, Right, and D to reset.
Scoreboard will update itself but incomplete.
